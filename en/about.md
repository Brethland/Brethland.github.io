## The Author(Brethland, Brethy, ゆき a.k.a. Yuki)

Mistakenly born as a boy and tries her best to change, she has an oriential culture base mixed with a western education, which is so common for all to escape from colonism and post-colonism. She speaks Shanghainese(mother tongue), Mandarin, English, Deutsch and a little Japanese. Tides of multilingual knowledges flow into her mind, though in an endless war against monolingualism. 

She found a reflection and an ideal ego on Yuki Nagato and then decided to read and write for herself. Her biggest wish is sitting inside Babel Library till life's end, or supposed to be so. While phenomenons arise and disappear, a core with rationality remains unchanged, she believed firmly.

She has belief on the God, in a Spinoza's meaning. Although she does not agree with all of the formality, she helds a positive opinion upon Christian religions, especially Protestantism. Her view upon world is more like a mix from Wittgenstein and Heidegger, the accurate description will be shown when talking with her.

She, luckily and thankfully, enjoys pure logical reasonings and dedicates most to mathematics. There's now little doubt that she will continue to do so.

## This Site

This site is intended as a personal blog. Related topics include mathematics, natural science, philosophy, literature(mainly in Chinese) and journals about real life, though the author has only received trainings on first two of them, the correctness should then be taken for grant as possible as I can. When finding any typo and wrong fact, please inform the author with an email.

Note that for different languages the site may vary, but a recommendation will appear on the page if there are other languages available. From time to time I will translate some pages(with loss of meanings) if possible, on the other hand they will be posted in original language at first, supports on translation are always welcome.

The site, which is ought to be purely statical, is served now on Github Pages with Jekyll. I tried to keep a minimalistic design and dependency. So far resources to be loaded are:
- jQuery 3.6.0
- Mathjax 2.7.7
- Noto Serif TC Font

An automatic selection of your language and reading scheme will be made, for aesthic reason there is no visible switcher with additional icons or such.

I am **not** in behave of any other entity and all opinions are on my own. Feel free to share site contents with others, unless you violated the CC-BY-NC-SA license.
