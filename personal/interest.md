I am interested in homotopy theory, especially the [motivic homotopy theory](/landscape/motivic.md) and its relation to algebraic $K$-theory, arithmetic cohomology and geometry. Currently, I am thinking about the $p$-adic rigidity of motivic homotopy category, using logarithmic techniques.

I have an interest on formalizing mathematics too, in particular, algebra in LEAN and homotopy theory in HoTT. Actually, the first inspiration that guides me to study maths is type theory. My [bachelor thesis](/personal/bachelor.md) is just about homotopy type theory.
