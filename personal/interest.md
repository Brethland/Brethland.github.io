I am interested in homotopy theory, especially the [motivic homotopy theory](/landscape/motivic.md) and its relation to algebraic $K$-theory, arithmetic cohomology and geometry.

I have an interest on formalizing mathematics too, in particular, algebra in <img src="../assets/Lean_logo.svg" title="Lean" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;" /> and homotopy theory in HoTT. Actually, the first inspiration that guides me to study maths is type theory. My [bachelor thesis](/personal/bachelor.md) is just about homotopy type theory.
