I am interested in homotopy theory, especially the [motivic homotopy theory](/landscape/motivic.md) and its relation to algebraic $K$-theory, arithmetic cohomology and geometry.

The first inspiration that guides me to study maths is type theory. My [bachelor thesis](/personal/bachelor.md) is just about homotopy type theory.
