In this thesis we study the theory of CW-complexes in a synthetic way. We first introduced some important concepts of Homotopy Type Theory and used them to define cell complexes as a homotopical pushout. After that, we have proven some topological properties of CW-complexes and calculated the homotopy groups of some examples with methods in type theory.
