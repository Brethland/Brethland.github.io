From October 2022 to July 2024, I studied mathematics with a minor in physics at [Universität Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/). I wrote my bachelor thesis under the supervision of [Florent Schaffhauser](/people/flo.md).

Since October 2024, I am pursing my master degree of mathematics at [Universität Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/). I am writing my master thesis about [motivic homotopy theory](/landscape/motivic.md).
