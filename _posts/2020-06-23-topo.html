<h2 id="topology">1.1 Topology</h2>
<h3 id="definition">1.1.1 Definition</h3>
<p>Let X be a non-empty set. A set τ of subsets of X is said to be a <strong>topology</strong> on X if</p>
<ol>
  <li>X ∈ τ and ∅ ∈ τ,</li>
  <li>the union of any (infinite or finite) number of sets in τ belongs to τ, and</li>
  <li>the intersection of any two sets in τ belongs to τ.</li>
</ol>
<p>The pair (X, τ) is called a <strong>topological space</strong>.</p>
<p>for example, Let N be the set of all natural numbers, let τ<sub>4</sub> consist of N, ∅, and all <em>finite</em>
  subsets of N. Then τ<sub>4</sub> is <em>not</em> a topology on N as any infinite union of sets in τ is not belonged
  to τ.</p>
<h3 id="definition-1">1.1.2 Definition</h3>
<p>Let X be any non-empty set and let τ be the collection of all subsets of X, then τ is called the <strong>discrete
    topology</strong> on X. The yopology space (X, τ) is called a <strong>discrete space</strong>.</p>
<p>There will be infinite number of discrete spaces.</p>
<p>If every infinite subset of an infinite subset is open or all infinite subsets are closed, then τ must be the
  discrete topology.</p>
<h3 id="definition-2">1.1.3 Definition</h3>
<p>Let X be any non-empty set and τ = {X, ∅}. Then τ is called the <strong>indiscrete topology</strong> and (X, τ) is
  said to be an <strong>indiscrete space</strong>.</p>
<p>There are also infinite number of indiscrete spaces.</p>
<h3 id="proposition">1.1.4 Proposition</h3>
<p>If (X, τ) is a topological space such that, for every x ∈ X, the singletion set {x} is in τ, then τ is a discrete
  topology.</p>
<p>We can see that if S be any subset of X, then</p>
<p>S = ∪<sub>x ∈ S</sub> x.</p>
<p>Since S is in τ, then τ is the set of all subsets of X.</p>
<p>Moreover, if <em>all</em> infinite subsets of an infinite set X is in topology τ, then τ must be a discrete
  topology, the proof is related to open and close sets.</p>
<h2 id="open-sets-closed-sets-and-clopen-sets">1.2 Open Sets, Closed Sets, and Clopen Sets</h2>
<h3 id="definition-3">1.2.1 Definition</h3>
<p>Let (X, τ) be any topological space. Then the members of τ are said to be <strong>open sets</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="proposition-1">1.2.2 Proposition</h3>
<p>If (X, τ) is any topological space, then</p>
<ol>
  <li>X and ∅ are open sets,</li>
  <li>the union of any (finite or infinite) number of open sets is an open set, and</li>
  <li>the intersection of any finite number of open sets is an open set.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can find that infinite intersections of open sets may not be open.</p>
<h3 id="definition-4">1.2.3 Definition</h3>
<p>Let (X, τ) be a topological space. A subset S of X is said to be a <strong>closed set</strong> in (X, τ) if its
  complement in X, namely X \ S, is Open in (X, τ).</p>
<h3 id="proposition-2">1.2.4 Proposition</h3>
<p>If (X, τ) is any topological space, then</p>
<ol>
  <li>∅ and X are closed sets,</li>
  <li>the intersection of any (finite or infinite) number of closed sets is a closed set and</li>
  <li>the union of any finite number of closed sets is a closed set.</li>
</ol>
<p>A set can be either open or closed or open and closed or neither open nor closed.</p>
<h3 id="definition-5">1.2.5 Definition</h3>
<p>A subset S of a topological space (X, τ) is said to be <strong>clopen</strong> if it is both open and closed in (X,
  τ).</p>
<h2 id="the-finite-closed-topology">1.3 The Finite-Closed Topology</h2>
<p>Sometimes it is more natural to define topology by saying which sets are closed.</p>
<h3 id="definition-6">1.3.1 Definition</h3>
<p>Let X be any non-empty set. A topology τ on X is called the <strong>finite-closed topology</strong> or the
  <strong>cofinite topology</strong> if the closed subsets of X are X and all finite subsets of X.</p>
<p>While all finite sets are closed, not all infinite sets are open. If a topological space has at least 3 distinct
  clopen subsets, then X must be a finite set.</p>
<h3 id="definition-7">1.3.2 Definition</h3>
<p>Let f be a function from a set X into a set Y.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The function f is said to be <strong>injective</strong> if f(x<sub>1</sub>) = f(x<sub>2</sub>) implies
    x<sub>1</sub> = x<sub>2</sub>, for x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub> ∈ X;</li>
  <li>The function f is said to be <strong>surjective</strong> if for each y ∈ Y there exists an x ∈ X such that f(x)
    = y;</li>
  <li>The function f is said to be <strong>bijective</strong> if it is both injective and surjective.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="definition-8">1.3.3 Definition</h3>
<p>Let f be a function from a set X into a set Y. The function f is said to <strong>have an inverse</strong> if there
  exists a function g of Y into X such that g(f(x)) = x, for all x ∈ X and f(g(y)) = y, for all y ∈ Y. The function g
  is called an <strong>inverse function</strong> of f.</p>
<h3 id="proposition-3">1.3.4 Proposition</h3>
<p>Let f be a function from a set X into a set Y.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The function f has an inverse if and only if f is bijective.</li>
  <li>Inverse is unique.</li>
  <li>g is an inverse function of f if and only if f is an inverse function of g.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="definition-9">1.3.5 Definition</h3>
<p>Let f be a function from a set X into a set Y. If S is any subset of Y, then the set f<sup>-1</sup>(S) is defined
  by</p>
<p>f<sup>-1</sup>(S) = {x : x ∈ X and f(x) ∈ S}.</p>
<p>The subset f<sup>-1</sup>(S) of X is said to be the <strong>inverse image</strong> of S.</p>
<p>There's an interesting conclusion of topology and inverse image: Let (Y, τ) be a topological space and X a
  non-empty set. Further, let f be a function from X into Y. Put τ<sub>1</sub> = {f<sup>-1</sup>(S) : S ∈ τ}. Then
  τ<sub>1</sub> is a topology on X.</p>
<h3 id="definition-10">1.3.6 Definition</h3>
<p>A topological space (X,τ) is said to be a <strong>T<sub>1</sub>-space</strong> if every singleton set {x} is closed
  in (X, τ).</p>
<p>A discrete space or an infinite set with the finite-set topology is a T<sub>1</sub>-space.</p>
<p>A topological space is said to be a <strong>T<sub>0</sub>-space</strong> if for each pair of distinct points a, b
  in X, either there exists an open set containing a and not b, or there exists an open set containing b and not a.
</p>
<p>Every T<sub>1</sub>-space is a T<sub>0</sub>-space.</p>
<h1 id="ch2-the-euclidean-topology">CH2 The Euclidean Topology</h1>
<h2 id="the-euclidean-topology-on-r">2.1 The Euclidean Topology on R</h2>
<h3 id="definition-11">2.1.1 Definition</h3>
<p>A subset S of R is said to be open in the <strong>euclidean topology on R</strong> if it has the following
  property:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For each x ∈ S, there exist a, b in R, with a &lt; b, such that x ∈ (a, b) ⊆ S.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have following interesting collaries from this definition.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Let r, s ∈ R with r &lt; s. In the euclidean topology τ on R, (r, s) is an open set.</li>
  <li>(r, ∞) and (-∞, r) are open sets for every real number r.</li>
  <li><em>Not</em> all open sets in euclidean space are intervals.</li>
  <li>For each c and d in R with c &lt; d, [c, d] is <em>not</em> an open set in R.</li>
  <li>For each a and b in R with a &lt; b, [a, b] is a closed set in the euclidean topology on R.</li>
  <li>R is a T<sub>1</sub>-space.</li>
  <li>Z is a closed subset of R.</li>
  <li>Q is neither a closed subset nor an open subset of R.</li>
  <li>The only clopen subsets of R are only R and ∅.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="basis-for-a-topology">2.2 Basis for a Topology</h2>
<h3 id="proposition-4">2.2.1 Proposition</h3>
<p>A subset S of R is open if and only if it is a union of open intervals.</p>
<h3 id="definition-12">2.2.2 Definition</h3>
<p>Let (X, τ) be a topological space. A collection B of open subsets of X is said to be a <strong>basis</strong> for
  the topology τ if every open set is a union of members of B.</p>
<p>B generates the whole topological space like basis in vector space in linear algebra.</p>
<p>τ itself is a basis for τ. We do have many bases for a topology. Generally, if B is a basis for τ, then let
  B<sub>1</sub> is a collection of subsets of X such that B ⊆ B<sub>1</sub> ⊆ τ, then B<sub>1</sub> is also a basis
  for τ.</p>
<h3 id="proposition-5">2.2.3 Proposition</h3>
<p>Let X be a non-empty set and let B be a collection of subsets of X. Then B is a basis for a topology on X if and
  only if B has the following properties:</p>
<ol>
  <li>X = ∪<sub>b ∈ B</sub>b and</li>
  <li>for any b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub> ∈ B, the set b<sub>1</sub> ∩ b<sub>2</sub> is a union of members of B.</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally, we can define a euclidean topology on R<sup>n</sup> = {&lt;x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, …,
  x<sub>n</sub>&gt; : x<sub>i</sub> ∈ R, i = 1, 2, …, n} as B = {&lt;x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, …,
  x<sub>n</sub>&gt; ∈ R<sup>n</sup> : a<sub>i</sub> &lt; x<sub>i</sub> &lt; b<sub>i</sub>, i = 1, 2, …, n} of
  R<sup>n</sup> with sides parallel to the axes.</p>
<p>Infact, we will often use open discs as a group of basis since it it the expantion of intervals on R.</p>
<h3 id="definition-13">2.2.4 Definition</h3>
<p>A topological space (X, τ) is said to satisfy the <strong>second axiom of countability</strong> if there exists a
  basis B for τ, where B consists of only a countable number of sets.</p>
<h2 id="basis-for-a-given-topology">2.3 Basis for a Given Topology</h2>
<h3 id="proposition-6">2.3.1 Proposition</h3>
<p>Let (X, τ) be a topological space. A family B of open subsets of X is a basis for τ if and only if for any point x
  belonging to any open set U, there is a b ∈ B such that x ∈ b ⊆ U.</p>
<h3 id="proposition-7">2.3.2 Proposition</h3>
<p>Let B be a basis for a topology τ on a set X. Then a subset U of X is open if and only if for each x ∈ U there
  exists a b ∈ B such that x ∈ b ⊆ U.</p>
<h3 id="proposition-8">2.3.3 Proposition</h3>
<p>Let B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> be bases for topologies τ<sub>1</sub> and τ<sub>2</sub>, respectively, on a
  non-empty set X. Then τ<sub>1</sub> = τ<sub>2</sub> if and only if</p>
<ol>
  <li>for each b ∈ B<sub>1</sub> and each x ∈ b, there exists a b' ∈ B<sub>2</sub> such that x ∈ b' ⊆ b, and</li>
  <li>for each b ∈ B<sub>2</sub> and each x ∈ b, there exists a b' ∈ B<sub>1</sub> such that x ∈ b' ⊆ b.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="definition-14">2.3.4 Definition</h3>
<p>Let (X, τ) be a topological space. A non-empty collection S of open subsets of X is said to be a
  <strong>subbasis</strong> for τ if the collection of all finite intersections of members of S forms a basis for τ.
</p>
<h1 id="ch3-limit-points">CH3 Limit Points</h1>
<h2 id="limit-points-and-closure">3.1 Limit Points and Closure</h2>
<p>It is better to say the elements of set X as <strong>point</strong> if (X, τ) is a topological space.</p>
<h3 id="definition-15">3.1.1 Definition</h3>
<p>Let A be a subset of a topological space (X, τ). A point x ∈ X is said to be a <strong>limit point</strong> (or
  <strong>accumulation point</strong> or <strong>cluster point</strong>) <strong>of A</strong> if every open set U,
  containing x contains a point of A different from x.</p>
<p>It is easy to verify that discrete space has no limit point. In indiscrete space, a set with at least two point
  will have all x ∈ X as its limit points.</p>
<h3 id="proposition-9">3.1.2 Proposition</h3>
<p>Let A be a subset of a topological space (X, τ). Then A is closed in (X, τ) if and only if A contains all of its
  limit points.</p>
<h3 id="proposition-10">3.1.3 Proposition</h3>
<p>Let A be a subset of a topological space (X, τ) and A' the set of all limit points of A. Then A ∪ A' is a closed
  set.</p>
<h3 id="definition-16">3.1.4 Definition</h3>
<p>Let A be a subset of a topological space (X, τ). Then the set A ∪ A' consisting of A and all its limit points is
  called the <strong>closure of A</strong> and is denoted by \~{A}.</p>
<p>\~{A} is the smallest closed set containing A, this implies that \~{A} is the intersection of all closed sets
  containing A.</p>
<p>For example, the closure of Q on R is R as every interval must contain one rational number.</p>
<h3 id="definition-17">3.1.5 Definition</h3>
<p>Let A be a subset of a topological space (X, τ). Then A is said to be <strong>dense</strong> in X or
  <strong>everywhere dense</strong> in X if \~{A} = X.</p>
<p>So Q is a dense subset of R.</p>
<h3 id="proposition-11">3.1.6 Proposition</h3>
<p>Let A be a subset of a topological space (X, τ). Then A is dense in X if and only if every non-empty open subset of
  X intersects A non-trivially (that is, if U ∈ τ and U ≠ ∅ then A ∩ U ≠ ∅).</p>
<h2 id="neighbourhoods">3.2 Neighbourhoods</h2>
<h3 id="definition-18">3.2.1 Definition</h3>
<p>Let (X, τ) be a topological space, N a subset of X and <em>p</em> a point in N. Then N is said to be a
  <strong>neighbourhood</strong> of the point if there exists an open set U such that p ∈ U ⊆ N.</p>
<h3 id="proposition-12">3.2.2 Proposition</h3>
<p>Let A be a subset of a topological space (X, τ). A point x ∈ X is a limit point of A if and only if every
  neighbourhood of x contains a point of A different from x.</p>
<h3 id="corollary">3.2.3 Corollary</h3>
<p>Let U be a subset of a topological space (X, τ). Then U ∈ τ if and only if for each x ∈ U there exists a V ∈ τ such
  that x ∈ V ⊆ U.</p>
<h3 id="definition-19">3.2.4 Definition</h3>
<p>A topological space (X, τ) is said to be <strong>separable</strong> if it has a dense subset which is countable.</p>
<h2 id="connectedness">3.3 Connectedness</h2>
<h3 id="lemma">3.3.1 Lemma</h3>
<p>Let <em>S</em> be a subset of <em>R</em> which is bounded above and let <em>p</em> be the supremum of <em>S</em>. If
  <em>S</em> is a closed subset of <em>R</em>, then <em>p</em> ∈ <em>S</em>.</p>
<h3 id="proposition-13">3.3.2 Proposition</h3>
<p>Let <em>T</em> be a clopen subset of <em>R</em>. Then either <em>T</em> = <em>R</em> or <em>T</em> = ∅.</p>
<h3 id="definition-20">3.3.3 Definition</h3>
<p>Let (X, τ) be a topological space. Then it is said to be <strong>connected</strong> if the only clopen subsets of
  <em>X</em> are <em>X</em> and ∅.</p>
<p>R is connected as above.</p>
<h3 id="proposition-14">3.3.4 Proposition</h3>
<p>A topological space (X, τ) is disconnected if and only if there are non-empty open sets <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>
  such that <em>A</em> ∩ <em>B</em> = ∅ and <em>A</em> ∪ <em>B</em> = X.</p>
<h1 id="ch4-homeomorphisms">CH4 Homeomorphisms</h1>
<h2 id="subspaces">4.1 Subspaces</h2>
<h3 id="definition-21">4.1.1 Definition</h3>
<p>Let <em>Y</em> be a non-empty subset of a topological space (X, τ). The collection τ<sub>Y</sub> = {O ∩ Y : O ∈ τ} of
  subsets of <em>Y</em> is a topology on <em>Y</em> called the <strong>subspace topology</strong> (or the
  <strong>relative topology</strong> or the <strong>induced topology</strong> or the *topology induced on <em>Y</em> by
  <em>τ</em>*). The topological space (Y, τ<sub>Y</sub>) is said to be a <strong>subspace</strong> of (X, τ).</p>
<p>Since the subspace will change the sets' properties, we must make clear in what space or what topology when we are
  talking about properties like open and close.</p>
<p>Topology induced on <em>Z</em> by eulidean topology on <em>R</em> is a discrete topology.</p>
<h3 id="definition-22">4.1.2 Definition</h3>
<p>A topological space (X, τ) is said to be <strong>Hausdorff</strong> (or a <strong>T<sub>2</sub> space</strong>) if
  given any pair of distinct points <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> in <em>X</em> there exists open sets <em>U</em> and
  <em>V</em> such that <em>a</em> ∈ <em>U</em>, <em>b</em> ∈ <em>V</em>, and <em>U</em> ∩ <em>V</em> = ∅.</p>
<p>every T<sub>2</sub> space is a T<sub>1</sub> space.</p>
<p>R is a T<sub>2</sub> space, and any subspace of T<sub>2</sub> space is a T<sub>2</sub> space.</p>
<h3 id="definition-23">4.1.3 Definition</h3>
<p>A topological space (X, τ) is said to be a <strong>regular space</strong> if for any closed subset <em>A</em> of
  <em>X</em> and any point <em>x</em> ∈ <em>X</em> \ <em>A</em>, there exist open sets <em>U</em> and <em>V</em> such
  that <em>x</em> ∈ <em>U</em>, <em>A</em> ⊆ <em>V</em>, and <em>U</em> ∩ <em>V</em> = ∅. If (X, τ) is regular and a
  T<sub>1</sub> space, then it is said to be a <strong>T<sub>3</sub> space</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="homeomorphisms">4.2 Homeomorphisms</h2>
<h3 id="definition-24">4.2.1 Definition</h3>
<p>Let (X, τ) and (Y, τ<sub>1</sub>) be topological spaces. Then they are said to be <strong>homeomorphic</strong> if
  there exists a function <em>f</em>: <em>X</em> → <em>Y</em> which has the following properties:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>f</em> is a bijection</li>
  <li>for each <em>U</em> ∈ τ<sub>1</sub>, /f/<sup>-1</sup>(U) ∈ τ, and</li>
  <li>for each <em>V</em> ∈ τ, /f/(V) ∈ τ<sub>1</sub>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Further, the map <em>f</em> is said to be a <strong>homeomorphism</strong> between (X, τ) and (Y, τ<sub>1</sub>). We
  write (X, τ) ≡ (Y, τ<sub>1</sub>).</p>
<p>Homeomorphism is a equivalence relation.</p>
<p>Every open interval (a, b) is homeomorphic to <em>R</em>.</p>
<h2 id="non-homeomorphic-spaces">4.3 Non-Homeomorphic Spaces</h2>
<h3 id="proposition-15">4.3.1 Proposition</h3>
<p>Any topological space homeomorphic to a connected space is connected.</p>
<h3 id="remark">4.3.2 Remark</h3>
<p>So far we have known twelve properties preserved by homeomorphisms, they are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>T<sub>0</sub>-space, T<sub>1</sub>-space, T<sub>2</sub>-space, regular space and T<sub>3</sub>-space</li>
  <li>the second axiom of countability</li>
  <li>separable space</li>
  <li>discrete and indiscrete space</li>
  <li>cofinite and cocountable space</li>
  <li>connectness</li>
</ol>
<p>If we want to prove two spaces are not homeomorphic, we just need to check whether one meets these properties and
  another not.</p>
<p>Also, homeomorphism must have the same cardinality on set and topology.</p>
<h3 id="definition-25">4.3.3 Definition</h3>
<p>A subset of <em>S</em> of <em>R</em> is said to be an <strong>interval</strong> if it has the following property: if
  <em>x</em> ∈ <em>S</em>, <em>z</em> ∈ <em>S</em>, and <em>y</em> ∈ <em>R</em> are such that <em>x</em> &lt; <em>y</em>
  &lt; <em>z</em>, then <em>y</em> ∈ <em>S</em>.</p>
<h3 id="proposition-16">4.3.4 Proposition</h3>
<p>A subspace <em>S</em> of <em>R</em> is connected if and only if it is an interval.</p>
<h3 id="corollary-1">4.3.5 Corollary</h3>
<p>If <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, and <em>d</em> are real numbers with <em>a</em> &lt; <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>
  &lt; <em>d</em>, then</p>
<ol>
  <li>(a, b) ¬≡ [c, d),</li>
  <li>(a, b) ¬ ≡ [<em>c</em>, <em>d</em>], and</li>
  <li>[a, b) ¬ ≡ [<em>c</em>, <em>d</em>].</li>

<h3 id="lemma-1">5.1.1 Lemma</h3>
<p>Let <em>f</em> be a function mapping <em>R</em> into itself. Then <em>f</em> is continuous if and only if for each
  <em>a</em> ∈ <em>R</em> and each open set <em>U</em> containing /f/(a), there exists an open set <em>V</em> containing
  <em>a</em> such that /f/(V) ⊆ <em>U</em>.</p>
<h3 id="lemma-2">5.1.2 Lemma</h3>
<p>Let <em>f</em> be a mapping of a topological space (X, τ) into a topological space (Y, τ'). Then the following two
  conditions are equivalent:</p>
<ol>
  <li>for each <em>U</em> ∈ τ', <em>f<sup>-1</sup></em> (U) ∈ τ;</li>
  <li>for each <em>a</em> ∈ <em>X</em> and each <em>U</em> ∈ τ' with /f/(a) ∈ <em>U</em>, there exists a <em>V</em> ∈ τ
    such that <em>a</em> ∈ <em>V</em> and /f/(V) ⊆ <em>U</em>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="definition-26">5.1.3 Definition</h3>
<p>Let (X, τ) and (Y, τ<sub>1</sub>) be topological spaces and <em>f</em> a function from <em>X</em> into <em>Y</em>.
  Then <em>f</em> : (X, τ) → (Y, τ<sub>1</sub>) is said to be a <strong>continuous mapping</strong> if for each
  <em>U</em> ∈ τ<sub>1</sub>, <em>f<sup>-1</sup></em> (U) ∈ τ.</p>
<p>Continuous relation is transitive.</p>
<p>If <em>f</em> and its inverse are all continuous, then <em>f</em> is a homeomorphism.</p>
<h3 id="proposition-17">5.1.4 Proposition</h3>
<p>Let (X, τ) and (Y, τ<sub>1</sub>) be topological spaces, <em>f</em> : (X, τ) → (Y, τ<sub>1</sub>) a continuous
  mapping. <em>A</em> a subset of <em>X</em>, and τ<sub>2</sub> the induced topology on <em>A</em>. Further let
  <em>g</em> : (A, τ<sub>2</sub>) → (Y, τ<sub>1</sub>) be the restriction of <em>f</em> to <em>A</em>; that is, /g/(x) =
